## Installation
Requires Python 3.x installation.

All of the watson-stt-wer-python dependencies are installed at once with `pip`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:**  If receiving an SSL Certificate error (CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED) when running the python scripts, try the following commands to tell python to use the system certificate store.

**_Windows_**
```
pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trustedhost files.python.org python-certifi-win32
```

**_MacOS_**

Open a terminal and change to the location of your python installation to execute `Install Certificates.command`, for example:
```
cd /Applications/Python 3.6
./Install Certificates.command
```

## Setup
Create a copy of `config.ini.sample`. You'll modify this file in subsequent steps.
```
cp config.ini.sample config.ini
```

Each sub-sections will describe what configuration parameters are needed.

# Generic Command-Line parameters

`--config_file` or `-c` is the configuration file to be used. The default is `config.ini`

`--log_level` or `-ll` is the log level to be used when running the script. Supported levels are as follows:
- `ERROR` -- Print out only when things fail.
- `WARN` -- Print out cautions and when things fail.
- `INFO` -- (Default) Print out useful status, cautions, and when things fail.
- `DEBUG` -- Print out every possible message.

# Transcription
Uses IBM Watson Speech to Text service to transcribe a folder full of audio files.  Creates a CSV with transcriptions.



## Setup
Update the parameters in your `config.ini` file.

Required configuration parameters:
* apikey - API key for your Speech to Text instance
* service_url - Reference URL for your Speech to Text instance
* base_model_name - Base model for Speech to Text transcription

Optional configuration parameters:
* max_threads - Maximum number of threads to use with `transcribe.py` to improve performance.
* language_model_id - Language model customization ID (comment out to use base model)
* acoustic_model_id - Acoustic model customization ID (comment out to use base model)
* grammar_name - Grammar name (comment out to use base model)
* stt_transcriptions_file - Output file for Speech to Text transcriptions
* audio_file_folder - Input directory containing your audio files
* reference_transcriptions_file - Reference file for manually transcribed audio files ("labeled data" or "ground truth").  If present, will be merged into `stt_transcriptions_file` as "Reference" column
* stemming - If True, pre-processing stems words with Porter stemmer. Stemming will treat singular/plural of a word as equivalent, rather than a word error.



## Execution
Assuming your configuration is in `config.ini`, transcribe all the audio files in `audio_file_folder` parameter via the following command:

```
python transcribe.py --config_file config.ini --log_level DEBUG
```

See [Generic Command Line Parameters](#generic-command-line-parameters) for more details.

## Output
Transcription will be stored in a CSV file based on `stt_transcriptions_file` parameter with a format like below:

Audio File|Transcription
-----|-----
file1.wav|The quick brown fox
file2.wav|jumped over the lazy dog

A third column, "Reference", will be included with the reference transcription, if a `reference_transcriptions_file` is found as source.

# Analysis
Simple python package to approximate the Word Error Rate (WER), Match Error Rate (MER), Word Information Lost (WIL) and Word Information Preserved (WIP) of one or more transcripts.

## Setup
Your config file must have references for the `reference_transcriptions_file` and `stt_transcriptions_file` properties.

* **Reference file** (`reference_transcriptions_file`) is a CSV file with at least columns called `Audio File Name` and `Reference`.  The `Reference` is the actual transcription of the audio file (also known as the "ground truth" or "labeled data"). NOTE: In your audio file name, make sure you put the full path (eg. ./audio1.wav)
* **Hypothesis file** (`stt_transcriptions_file`) is a CSV file with at least columns called `Audio File Name` and `Hypothesis`.  The `Hypothesis` is the transcription of the audio file by the Speech to Text engine.  The `transcribe.py` script can create this file.

## Results
* **Details** (`details_file`) is a CSV file with rows for each audio sample, including reference and hypothesis transcription and specific transcription errors
* **Summary** (`summary_file`) is a JSON file with metrics for total transcriptions and overall word and sentence error rates.
* **Accuracy** (`word_accuracy_file`) is a CSV file with rows

## Metrics (Definitions)
- WER (word error rate), commonly used in ASR assessment, measures the cost of restoring the output word sequence to the original input sequence.
- MER (match error rate) is the proportion of I/O word matches which are errors.
- WIL (word information lost) is a simple approximation to the proportion of word information lost which overcomes the problems associated with the RIL (relative information lost) measure that was proposed half a century ago.

## Background on supporting library
Repo of the Python module JIWER: https://pypi.org/project/jiwer/

It computes the minimum-edit distance between the ground-truth sentence and the hypothesis sentence of a speech-to-text API.
The minimum-edit distance is calculated using the python C module python-Levenshtein.

## Execution

```
python analyze.py --config_file config.ini --log_level DEBUG
```

See [Generic Command Line Parameters](#generic-command-line-parameters) for more details.

# Analysis with sclite
This repo provides a wrapper script, `optional_analyze_with_sclite.py`, to run `sclite`, which is an open source tool designed to evaluate STT transcription results. `sclite` goes beyound regular WER and SER reporting to provide reports like Confusion Pairs to show exactly which words were substituted with what, or Text Alignment which shows the inline differences between the reference and transcribed texts. For more information about the output of `optional_analyze_with_sclite.py` see the results sub-section below. For more information about `sclite`, see -- https://people.csail.mit.edu/joe/sctk-1.2/doc/sclite.htm#sclite_name_0.

## Setup
1. `reference_transcriptions_file` and `stt_transcriptions_file` must be populated in `config.ini` and exist on the filesystem.
1. `sclite_directory` must be uncommented and populated with the directory that hold the `sclite` executable
    1. To install `sclite` follow the instructions here -- https://github.com/usnistgov/SCTK#sctk-basic-installation

## Execution

```
python optional_analyze_with_sclite.py --config config.ini --log_level INFO
```
See [Generic Command Line Parameters](#generic-command-line-parameters) for more details.

## Results
1. `sclite_wer_summary.json` -- A concise summary of metrics
1. `*.sys` -- A summary file showing the number of words, sentences, deletions, insertions, substitutions, word error rate, and sentence error rate.
1. `*.prf` -- A text alignment file that shows, for each audio file, the reference text and transcribed text, and for each word whether it was inserted, deleted, substituted, or correct.
1. `*.dtl` -- A detail file showing confusion pairs and which specific words were inserted, deleted, or substituted.

There will also be the following two files that were created for use by `sclite` but are not direct outputs of `sclite`:
1. `*.ctm` -- A file containing a line for each transcribed word of each audio file
1. `*.stm` -- A file containing a reformatted version of the `reference_transcriptions_file` that `sclite` uses for evalutation

# Experimenting
Use the `experiment.py` script to execute a series of Transcription/Analyze experiments to optimize SpeechToText parameters. 

## Setup

Follow the setup for [Transcribing](#transcription).

Follow the setup for [Analyzing](#analysis).

The following parameters in `[Experiments]` all have a `*_min` and `*_max` variant to specify the lower limit and upper limit, respectively, for its corresponding `[SpeechToText]` parameter, and a `*_step` variant to specify the amount to increase that parameter in each experiment:
1. `sds_*` controls the `speech_detector_sensitivity` parameter
1. `bias_*` controls the `character_insertion_bias` parameter
1. `cust_weight_*` controls the `customization_weight` parameter
1. `bas_*` controls the `background_audio_suppression`parameter

Note: If you want to use `sclite` for analysis of each experiment be sure to configure `sclite_directory` under the `[ErrorRateOutput]` section.

## Execution

```
python experiment.py --config_file config.ini --log_level INFO
```

See [Generic Command Line Parameters](#generic-command-line-parameters) for more details.

## Results
Each experiment creates a unique directory based on the parameters of that experiment in the format `bias_<bias-value>_weight_<customization-weight-value>_sds_<sds-value>_bas_<bas-value>`.

For each experiment the output files from [Transcribing](#transcription) and [Analyzing](#analysis) will be created in its unique output directory. 

There will be a final file created called `all_summaries.csv` that contains the summary of all experiments in a single CSV.   

# Model training
The `models.py` script has wrappers for many model-related tasks including creating models, updating training contents, getting model details, and training models.

## Setup
Update the parameters in your `config.ini` file.

Required configuration parameters:
* apikey - API key for your Speech to Text instance
* service_url - Reference URL for your Speech to Text instance
* base_model_name - Base model for Speech to Text transcription

## Execution
For general help, execute:
```
python models.py
```

The script requires a type (one of base_model,custom_model,corpus,word,grammar) and an operation (one of list,get,create,update,delete)
The script optionally takes a config file as an argument with `-c config_file_name_goes_here`, otherwise using a default file of `config.ini` which contains the connection details for your speech to text instance.
Depending on the specified operation, the script also accepts a name, description, and file for an associated resource.  For instance, new custom models should have a name and description, and a corpus should have a name and associated file.

## Examples

List all base models:
```
python models.py -o list -t base_model
```

List all custom models:
```
python models.py -o list -t custom_model
```

Create a custom model:
```
python models.py -o create -t custom_model -n "model1" -d "my first model"
```

Add a corpus file for a custom model (the custom model's customization_id is stored in `config.ini.model1`)(`corpus1.txt` contains the corpus contents):
```
python models.py -c config.ini.model1 -o create -n "corpus1" -f "corpus1.txt" -t corpus
```

Create corpora for all corpus files in a directory (the filename will be used for the corpora name)
```
python models.py -c config.ini.model1 -o create -t corpus -dir corpus-dir
```

List all corpora for a custom model (the custom model's customization_id is stored in `config.ini.model1`):
```
python models.py -c config.ini.model1 -o list -t corpus
```

Train a custom model (the custom model's customization_id is stored in `config.ini.model1`):
```
python models.py -c config.ini.model1 -o update -t custom_model
```

Note some parameter combinations are not possible.  The operations supported all wrap the SDK methods documented at https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/speech-to-text.
